# Seed Banks as Incidental Fungal Endophyte Banks #

A presentation given on 10th May 2021 at the weekly **K**ew **A**dvances in **B**otany **a**nd **M**ycology seminar, summarising the results of our study [Hill et al. (2021) Seed Banks as Incidental Fungi Banks: Fungal Endophyte Diversity in Stored Seeds of Banana Wild Relatives. Front. Microbiol. 12:643731. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2021.643731](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.643731/full).
